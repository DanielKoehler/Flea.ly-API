Flealy
======

An online shopping platform by Kiran Panesar at Cardiff University (coursework piece for CM1102)

Enter your postcode, see what items people are selling near you.

Database dump
------
I added a database dump in commit [708d9bd](https://github.com/KiranPanesar/Flealy/commit/708d9bda575bf61679085357c50d8f8cc4dd4efd). Just import this into your phpMyAdmin (or whatever tool you're using) and then update the database connector in the /api/api.php file ([this function](https://github.com/KiranPanesar/Flealy/blob/master/api/api.php#L145)). Google around of [email me](kiransinghpanesar@googlemail.com) if you get stuck.

Restrictions

Restrictions for this project are
* Must be a shopping platform
